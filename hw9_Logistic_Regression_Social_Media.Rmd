summary(multiple_logistic)
#Intercept=-12.38773, represents the log odds of having trouble falling asleep when all predictors are zero (theoretically not possible here due to the nature of the variables).
#Linkedin_spent:-0.02080, For each additional unit of time spent on LinkedIn, the log odds of having trouble falling asleep decrease by 0.0208.However, this effect is not statistically significant (p = 0.0657), only marginally significant.
#Snapchat_spent: 0.03741. For each additional unit of time spent on Snapchat, the log odds of having trouble falling asleep increase by 0.0374, with statistical significance (p = 0.0499), suggesting a positive correlation between Snapchat use and sleep difficulties.
#How_felt: 3.69968, reflects the impact of users' feelings on trouble falling asleep, with an increase in one unit of feeling rating increasing the log odds of trouble sleeping by approximately 3.7, nearly reaching statistical significance (p = 0.0559), indicating that how users felt might affect their sleep quality to some extent.
#The model suggests that people who spends more time on Linkedin and less on Snapchat is easily to fall asleep.
#total p-value(0.0536)>0.05,which is not very significance. But p(Snapchat_spent)<0.05 and others'p values are close to 0.05.
